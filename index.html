<h1>Unit 2 Design Challenge</h1>

<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>I am most inspired by <a href="http://flandriatype.com">flandriatype.com</a> and <a href="http://www.tankboys.biz">tankboys.biz</a>.</p>

<h2>How to they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<p>Site 1 is inteded to showcase the font Flandria and its utility in multiple design scenarios. What first grabs my attention about this site is the layering effect that occurs when one scrolls below the fold. This effect serves to create an excellent sense flow that piques the audience's curiosity. As the user scrolls further down, images and the font itself coincide and align, demonstrating the fonts potential in multiple settings and encouraging the user to explore further. The site also maintains a strong visual balance by adhering to consistent amounts of negative space on the left and right planes throughout. The font is always centered on the page and, in this way, is almost always the focal point.</p>

<p>I am very inspired by Site 2 because it is clear to me that the designer truly had its audience in mind when creating the site. It is a little different and is visually quite stark, which places more emphasis on the art pieces themselves. The overwhelmingly minimilistic appraoch is original (the site almost looks like a scan of an old book) and encourages the user to explore. The site uses a 2-grid approach, which does force the user to choose between two separate actions (whether to explore the left side or the right side), but also strikes a pleasing symetry and sense of visual balance.</p>
