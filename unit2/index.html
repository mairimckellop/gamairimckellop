<h1>Unit 2 Design Challenge</h1>

<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>I am most inspired by <a href="http://flandriatype.com">flandriatype.com</a> and <a href="http://www.tankboys.biz">tankboys.biz</a>.</p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<p>Site 1 is inteded to showcase the font Flandria and its utility in multiple design scenarios. What first grabs my attention about this site is the layering effect that occurs when one scrolls below the fold. This effect serves to create an excellent sense flow that piques the audience's curiosity. As the user scrolls further down, images and the font itself coincide and align, demonstrating the fonts potential in multiple settings and encouraging the user to explore further. The site also maintains a strong visual balance by adhering to consistent amounts of negative space on the left and right planes throughout. The font is always centered on the page and, in this way, is almost always the focal point.</p>

<p>I am very inspired by Site 2 because it is clear to me that the designer truly had its audience in mind when creating the site. It is a little different and is visually quite stark, which places more emphasis on the art pieces themselves. The overwhelmingly minimilistic appraoch is original (the site almost looks like a scan of an old book) and encourages the user to explore. The site uses a 2-grid approach, which does force the user to choose between two separate actions (whether to explore the left side or the right side), but also strikes a pleasing symetry and sense of visual balance.</p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

<p>These two sites are most different in terms of heirarchy and flow. Site 1 has an incredibly simple heirarchy. It uses a single grid and really essentailly is a single page. The audience can gain an incredible amount of information with out once navigating away from the landing page. Site 2, however, uses a 2 - grid approach and the user must click on the title of each piece to view its entirety and learn more about the though that went into it.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

<p><strong>Site 1 - Thumbnail #1</strong></p>
<p>I think the site, and the artist as well, would benefit from a page dedicated soley to her background and contact information. Right now her contact info is listed almost as an afterthought at the bottom of the page. If I were trying to get in touch with her, rather than simply exploring the site for fun, I would not immediately scroll through the entire page to see if her information was at the bottom. I would likely look for a 'Bio' page that would provide this information. I might also consider adding a message box where interested parties could email the artist directly, which would facilitate the use of her font.</p>

<p><strong>Site 1 - Thumbnail #2</strong></p>
<p>While the url does suggest this site is dedicated to a specific typeface, the same notion is not as explicit when looking at the home page by itself. Because of this, one improvement I might consider would be to add a black column to the right hand side that would contain a brief description of the site, font, etc. The dark color would be weighty enough to balance out the large "Flandria" on the left side of the page.</p>

<li><img src="thumbnail3.jpg"></li>
<p><strong>Site 2 - Thumbnail #1</strong></p>
<p>I think the information on this site could potentially be better represented by a 3-grid approach: one column to house artist information/ description, one column for the section entitled "Work" and one column for the section entitled "Etcetera". By taking this approach, the user could click on a specific piece and simultaneously view the description in the left hand column.</p>

<li><img src="thumbnail4.jpg"></li>
<p><strong>Site 2 - Thumbnail #2</strong></p>
<p>Site 2 might also benefit from taking an appraoch similar to Site 1, that is, one page that continues under the fold. This would allow more artwork to be displayed at once and would minimize the effort required by the user to navigate back and forth through pieces and artist information.</p>
