<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a consultant, living in Boulder, Colorado. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I eventually want to start my own company and I want to develop the ability to more effectively communicate with developers/ designers. I’m also just passionate about design in general! </p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Product Manager with an early stage green tech startup because I like to work in a fast paced environment where I am required to wear many hats.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Beyond Coal to Clean Energy Campaign Intern, Sierra Club
